# Projects Portfolio

## About This Repository

This repository is my curated portfolio of machine learning, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, and geospatial projects.

It is organized as a clean, GitHub-ready collection where each project lives in its own folder with its own `README.md` and runnable code/notebooks.

The goal of this portfolio is to showcase practical project work across:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Computer Vision (CV)
- Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
- Geospatial data processing
- Model training and evaluation workflows

## Repository Structure

Each folder at the root is an independent project.

Notable folders include:

- `face-anti-spoofing-inference-api`
- `human-activity-recognition-system-fyp`
- `underwater-pose-annotation-pipeline`
- `distilbert-text-classification-notebook`
- `gpt2-text-classification-urdu-notebook`
- `gpt3-api-text-classification-notebook`
- `xlnet-sentiment-classification`
- `skin-cancer-transformer-transfer-learning`
- `pneumonia-classification-project`
- `google-reviews-nlp-pipeline`

Practice-oriented projects are grouped separately in:

- `Basics_Practice_Projects/`

## Technology Coverage

Across projects, this portfolio uses:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- Hugging Face Transformers
- OpenCV
- Pandas and NumPy

## How To Explore

1. Start from any project folder.
2. Open that project?s `README.md` for details.
3. Follow the setup/run instructions in that project.

Most notebook-based projects can be opened directly in Jupyter/Colab.

## Notes

- This repository was cleaned and structured specifically for portfolio presentation.
- Large/sensitive artifacts were excluded from this version.
- Each project folder is intended to be independently understandable.
